# Model Card

For additional information see the Model Card paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf

## Model Details
- We used a Random Forest Classifier
- Version 1.0.0
- Created on 25/01/2023
- For more information about the model, please refer to Udacity Nanodegree program


## Intended Use
- This project is intended to solve a project of mlops deploying a Scalable ML Pipeline in Production
- The target is to predict if an income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data


## Factors
- The data is from UCI (https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/datasets?search=Census+Income++)
- This data about census data

## Metrics
We used metrics: fbeta_score, precision_score and recall_score.

## Evaluation Data
We used 20% of the dataset for evaluation purposes of the model.

## Training Data
We used 80% of the dataset for the training purposes of the model.

## Quantitative Analyses
Model performance is measured with the overall metrics and slice performance analysis
